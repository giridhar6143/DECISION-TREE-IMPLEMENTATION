Task 1: Decision Tree Model – Classification and Visualization
Task Description
The objective of Task 1 is to build and visualize a Decision Tree model using the Scikit-learn library. Decision Trees are supervised machine learning algorithms widely used for classification and regression problems because of their simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness.
In this task, a suitable dataset is selected where the goal is to predict a target variable based on multiple input features. The dataset is first explored to understand its structure, feature types, and potential data quality issues such as missing values or outliers.
Implementation Details
The workflow begins with data preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. After preprocessing, a DecisionTreeClassifier is implemented using Scikit-learn. Hyperparameters such as maximum depth and splitting criteria are adjusted to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
One of the key highlights of this task is the visualization of the decision tree, which helps in understanding how the model makes decisions. The tree structure clearly shows feature-based splits, decision rules, and class predictions. This interpretability makes decision trees particularly useful in domains like healthcare and finance.
Evaluation
The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The results are analyzed to understand model strengths and limitations.
